We are trying to implement a software for a logistics management company. We have linked our services to another corporation which gives us a set of parcels/orders to be delivered to different locations.
Out motto is to develop a way to efficiently manage the databases of our employees and assign them with orders to be delivered and to produce an output in the form of a Graph.



We would be having an employee database,and a database consisting of all the orders with their unique order Id.
Now we have already received the parcel from the user and our process starts now and our aim being,delivering the parcel by the earliest with keeping in mind the cost factor.We then process our orders(apply algorithm) and distribute them in such a manner that we are able to build an efficient system.Now we assign orders to our employees(delivery persons) and return the shortest path which each employee would follow while delivering the parcels using Graph Theory and output the path based upon the input given..
There would be a registration page and login page exclusively for the manager who will then be able to make changes to the employee database and the database of the orders..Manager would be able to see a graph which every delivery person would follow and to each delivery person the path followed by him/her would be shared via
e-mail.
